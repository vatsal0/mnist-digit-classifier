# mnist-digit-classifier
 
### Setup and Dependencies
The [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) of handwritten digit images is used for training and testing the neural network implemented in this project. The datasets should be downloaded and stored in the data folder. \
This project uses the [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) for linear algebra operations, which you can install with `brew install gsl` \
[libbmp](https://github.com/marc-q/libbmp) is a simple open source library I used to output the MNIST digit images in a viewable format. This is a submodule and does not need to be installed.
